## A Walk Down Memory Lane

The gathering took place at the home of one of our colleagues, a cozy haven that was soon filled with familiar faces and the warm embrace of friendship. As we reminisced about our formative years in PLN, it was incredible to see how far we have come since our days in the technical training program, affectionately known as "PLN Angkatan 7 Jalur Pelaksana".

The conversations flowed as freely as the delectable Eid treats. Stories of our early days in the field, the successes, the challenges, and the bonds we forged through hard work and shared experiences, were recounted with enthusiasm and fondness. Each tale told was a reminder of the journey we had embarked on together and the shared dreams we continue to pursue. Without realizing it, we have all now become parents.

## Parenting Moments

One of the most endearing highlights of the reunion was the presence of our children, who quickly became the stars of the event. As the adults caught up, the little ones mingled effortlessly, playing games and forming friendships of their own, a new generation of bonds taking shape. At one point, the living room was transformed into an impromptu play area, filled with laughter and the sounds of tiny footsteps running around.

A particularly memorable moment was when two of the kids decided to host a "talent show," showcasing their unique skills. Their enthusiasm and creativity left everyone in stitches and served as a charming reminder of the joys of parenthood we now share. Another touching scene unfolded when a child, eager to demonstrate their reading skills, gathered a small audience to listen. It was heartwarming to see the pride in their parents' eyes, a universal moment every parent cherishes.

## Unity and Gratitude

In addition to reliving past memories, the gathering was an opportunity to express gratitude for the support and camaraderie that have helped us navigate our careers and personal lives. It was a time to acknowledge the growth and achievements of our peers, celebrate our shared heritage, and strengthen the bonds that unite us.
