I am an Electrical Engineer and applied Machine Learning researcher working at the intersection of data-driven methods and large-scale power system operations. I am currently based in Indonesia, with over eight years of industry-embedded experience at [PLN](https://web.pln.co.id/en/about-us/company-profile), where I have developed and deployed analytical systems for national power distribution networks.

My work focuses on applying machine learning to smart grid analytics, particularly electricity theft detection and non-technical loss mitigation in large-scale energy systems. I am interested in how anomaly detection, cost-sensitive learning, and ranking-based decision models can be integrated into real-world operational workflows, where decisions must be made under uncertainty, limited resources, and explicit economic trade-offs. Rather than treating prediction as an isolated task, my research frames machine learning as a decision-support tool for improving the reliability, efficiency, and resilience of critical energy infrastructure.

I am currently completing a Master’s degree in Technology Management with a specialization in Business Analytics at [ITS](https://www.its.ac.id/simt/en/home-2/). My academic training complements my professional experience by strengthening my methodological foundation in machine learning and data-driven decision-making, particularly for deployment-aware applications in complex systems. My research has resulted in peer-reviewed publications in data science and energy-related venues, as well as the development of operational analytics systems with measurable real-world impact.

Beyond research, I am actively involved in mentoring and collaborative knowledge sharing, including supervising undergraduate research projects and delivering guest lectures on applied machine learning and data analytics. I am broadly interested in collaborations at the intersection of machine learning, energy systems, and large-scale infrastructure analytics. Further details on my work can be found in my [CV](https://dinoarla.com/assets/pdf/dino-cv.pdf) and [publications](https://dinoarla.com/publications/) listed below.
