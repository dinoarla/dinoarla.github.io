I am an Electrical Engineer and applied Machine Learning researcher with over eight years of industry experience in national power system operations. My work at Indonesia’s largest electricity utility has focused on deploying data-driven solutions for smart grid operations, particularly large-scale electricity theft detection and decision-support systems for non-technical loss mitigation.

I am currently completing a Master’s degree in Technology Management with a specialization in Business Analytics at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS)](https://www.its.ac.id/simt/en/home-2/). This academic training has strengthened my methodological foundation in machine learning, cost-sensitive learning, and data-driven decision-making, directly informing my research on scalable AI methods for real-world energy systems.

My research centers on developing deployable machine learning methodologies for smart grid analytics, with an emphasis on anomaly detection, ranking-based decision models, and cost-sensitive learning under operational constraints. By integrating large-scale consumption data, spatial characteristics, and economic considerations, I aim to bridge the gap between predictive performance and actionable decision-making in modern energy infrastructure.

Through industry-embedded research and peer-reviewed contributions, I work toward advancing applied machine learning approaches that enhance the resilience, efficiency, and economic sustainability of large-scale power systems.
